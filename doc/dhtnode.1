.TH DHTNODE 1 2016-06-27

.SH NAME
.B dhtnode
- a simple OpenDHT command line node runner.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dhtnode [-h]

.B dhtnode [-v[\fIlogfile\fP]] [-i] [-d] [-n \fInetwork_id\fP] [-p \fIlocal_port\fP] [-b[\fIbootstrap_host\fP[:\fIport\fP]]]

.SH DESCRIPTION

This program runs a simple OpenDHT node in an interactive way. If you rather
want to run the node in daemon mode, option \fB'-d'\fP is provided. When running
in the interactive shell, you benefit from the readline capabilities for writing
your commands such as command history. Here are the available commands in the
interactive shell:

.EE
    h, help    Print this help message.
    q, quit    Quit the program.
    log        Start/stop printing DHT logs.

    Node information:
    ll         Print basic information and stats about the current node.
    ls         Print basic information about current searches.
    ld         Print basic information about currenty stored values on this node.
    lr         Print the full current routing table of this node

    Operations on the DHT:
    b ip:port             Ping potential node at given IP address/port.
    g [key]               Get values at [key].
    l [key]               Listen for value changes at [key].
    p [key] [str]         Put string value at [key].
    s [key] [str]         Put string value at [key], signed with our generated
                          private key.
    e [key] [dest] [str]  Put string value at [key], encrypted for [dest] with
                          its public key (if found).

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB-h\fP
Prints some help.

.TP
\fB-v\fP\fIlogfile\fP
Enable the verbose mode. Optionally provide a log file.

.TP
\fB-i\fP
Generate cryptographic identity for the node.

.TP
\fB-d\fP
Run the program in daemon mode (will fork in the background).

.TP
\fB-n\fP \fInetwork_id\fP
Specify the network id. This let you connect to distinct networks and prevents
the merge of two different networks (available since OpenDHT v0.6.1).

.TP
\fB-p\fP \fIlocal_port\fP
Use port \fIlocal_port\fP for the program to bind to.

.TP
\fB-b\fP\fIbootstrap_host\fP[:\fIport\fP]
The program needs to be given a node to connect to the network. You use this
option to provide the ip address of that node.
